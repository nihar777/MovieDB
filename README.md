In this project I have used all of the following libraries :-
    "@react-native-community/masked-view": "^0.1.10",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^5.9.4",
    "@react-navigation/stack": "^5.14.4",
    "axios": "^0.21.1",
    "native-base": "^2.15.2",
    "react": "17.0.1",
    "react-native": "0.64.0",
    "react-native-axios": "^0.17.1",
    "react-native-circular-progress": "^1.3.7",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "^1.10.3",
    "react-native-reanimated": "^2.1.0",
    "react-native-responsive-screen": "^1.4.2",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^3.2.0",
    "react-native-screens": "^3.1.0",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^8.1.0"
    
   ==> The Mark As Favorite function doesn't work because the issue comes from the API Side.
